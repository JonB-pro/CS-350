# CS-350
Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech


### Summary of the projects.
The first project was for the board to flash SOS in morse code, then switch to OK when either side button was pressed. The second project was a mock thermostat that lit an LED while heating, and output current heat, set heat, if it is actively heating, and how long the program has been running.

### What did you do particularly well?
I believe my overall program ran well and gave the correct output, and that my code was fairly easy to read.

### Where could you improve?
I believe my state machines could have been built more efficiently, and the timer utilized better.

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The C language, embedded programming, and code composer studio are all new to me, and now I know how to utilize them in at least a basiuc fashion.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Again, C and code composer could prove useful in the future.

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using proper commenting and reusing functions where possible.
